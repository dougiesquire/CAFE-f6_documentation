Producing these docs
====================

These pages include information on how to generate all of the figures and analysis in these docs using Australia's National Computational Infrastructure. To reproduce the steps described below, users will need to have access to projects xv83, oi10, and ua8 which house the CAFE-f6, CMIP6 and reference datasets. Below, we describe how to set up the analysis environment, how to pre-process the data for assessment and how to perform the skill assessment. Auto-generated documentation of the Python code used to carry out these tasks is also provided.
