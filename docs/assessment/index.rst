Assessment
==========

These pages present some preliminary assessment of the skill of the CAFE-f6 hindcasts. The assessment approach largely follows the assessment of the CanESM5 decadal hindcasts in :footcite:t:`sospedra2021decadal`. Skill scores are computed for the CAFE-f6 hindcasts, and for the (40 ensemble member) CanESM5 :footcite:p:`sospedra2021decadal` and (10 ensemble member) EC-Earth3 :footcite:p:`bilbao2021assessment` CMIP6 Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP) hindcast submissions for comparison. Note that the CanESM5 hindcasts are initialised at the end of December every year, while the CAFE-f6 and EC-Earth3 hindcasts are initialised at the beginning of November every year.

The following pages present the skill assessment of a number of global and regional variables and processes. If you wish to see anything added to these pages, please open an issue `here <https://github.com/dougiesquire/Squire_2022_CAFE-f6/issues>`_.
