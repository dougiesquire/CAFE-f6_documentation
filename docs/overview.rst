The CAFE-f6 hindcasts/forecasts
===============================

The model
---------

The CAFE-f6 decadal forecasts (and hindcasts) are generated using the Climate Analysis Forecast Ensemble (CAFE) near-term climate prediction system, that was developed by the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Decadal Climate Forecast Project (DCFP). The system uses the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model (GFDL) version 2.1 [Delworth_et_al_2006]_, with an upgraded oceanic component (MOM5.1) and an atmospheric model resolution of 2 deg in latitude and 2.5 deg in longitude. A detailed description of the CAFE modelling system can be found in [O'Kane at al, 2018]_, [OKane_2021a]_ and [OKane_2021b]_.
