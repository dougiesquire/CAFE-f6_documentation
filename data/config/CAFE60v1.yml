# Config file for specifying processing using src.prepare_data()
# ==================================================================================

# name: required
#    The name of the dataset. Must match a method in src.prepare_data._open
# rename: optional
#    Translation between desired variable names and native variable names
# scale_variables: optional
#    Variable scale factors
# prepare: required
#    Output variables to prepare and save. Each variable can include the following
#    uses: required
#        List of input variables required to compute the output variable. For some 
#        datasets, this should be further broken into subkeys indicating the realm 
#        for each list of variables (e.g. ocean_month). Non-native variable names 
#        can be provided when an appropriate `rename` key is also provided
#    preprocess: optional
#        Functions and kwargs from src.utils to be applied sequentially prior to 
#        concatenation (for datasets comprised of multiple concatenated) and/or 
#        prior to merging of variables from multiple realms into a single dataset.
#        These are applied before the variables are renamed and rescaled.
#    apply: optional
#        Functions and kwargs from src.utils to be applied sequentially to opened 
#        dataset. These are applied after the variables are renamed and rescaled
