# Config file for specifying processing using src.prepare_data()
# ==================================================================================

# name: required
#    The name of the dataset. Must match a method in src.prepare_data._open
# prepare: required
#    Output variables to prepare and save. Each variable can include the following
#    identifier: required
#        Unique identifier for the output variable being processed. This will be 
#        used to save this diagnostics as: {name}.{identifier}.zarr.
#    uses: required
#        List of input variables required to compute the output variable. For some 
#        datasets, this should be further broken into subkeys indicating the realm 
#        for each list of variables (e.g. ocean_month). Alternatively, users can
#        provide the identifier of a previously prepared dataset by entering
#        `prepared: <identifier>`.
#    preprocess: optional
#        Functions and kwargs from src.utils to be applied sequentially prior to 
#        concatenation (for datasets comprised of multiple concatenated) and/or 
#        prior to merging of variables from multiple realms into a single dataset.
#        These are applied before the variables are renamed and converted.
#    apply: optional
#        Functions and kwargs from src.utils to be applied sequentially to opened 
#        dataset. These are applied after the variables are renamed and converted.
